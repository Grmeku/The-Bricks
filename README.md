SOCCER BRICK BREAKER GAME

My name is Luka Grmek and I made a The bricks game using CSS, HTML and JAVASCRIPT.
I am a 4th year student at the electrical and computer science school in Nova Gorica where I attend the computer science program.

HOW TO PLAY:
Press the start button to start the game and then use your left and right arrow key to move the paddle and prevent the ball from touching the bottom border of the game.
You can press the stop button to pause the game and once you are ready you just press the start button and the game will countinue from where you paused it.
Once the ball touches the border bellow the paddle you lose the game. Your goal is to destroy all the bricks by bouncing the ball off of them. Each brick has 3 lives
so you have to hit each brick 3 times to fully destroy it. Once you destroy all 15 bricks you win the game. CONGRATULATIONS!!!
